# DeepLearningTutorial
The Deep Learning Tutorial is a small class of four students facilitated by Professor Philip Sterne in developing their own syllabus for drilling deeply into Deep Learning. Topics covered include the basics of neural networks (NN), computer vision (CV), generative adversarial networks (GAN), reinforcement learning (RL), automated machine learning (AutoML), and natural language processing (NLP).
